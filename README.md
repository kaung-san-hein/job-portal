### Features
You can create an account on the `register` page and `log in` with your credential. But I used `local storage` to save it because this is a `testing state`. Finally, you can `log out`. 

More than that, you can find a job on the job listing page and do all `filter` functions (Job Type, Job Location, and Company). Finally, if you click a job card, you will find a `job detail` page.
